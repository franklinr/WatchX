Click the button again to go to etch a sketch.  Just move your wrist around to control the direction of the drawing tool.

Click the button again and you will get to space invaders which you can play by moving your wrist back and forth.

Click the button again and you will get to asteroids which you can play by rolling your wrist back and forth.

The bottom right button will wake from sleep and clear screen during etch a sketch.  Sleep code has been improved to disable ADC.

You will need this library.  You should be able to download it directly or within the arduino library.
